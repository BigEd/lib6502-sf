I am thinking it might be nicer to fork a copy of run6502.c and make a dedicated '65tube' command (don't call it that) - that way run6502 won't be cluttered and all the irrelevant arguments can be omitted from tube vsn help. That would also allow me to support syntax: ./not65tube go 1900 to run commands instead of hacky and arguably confusing -c which needs the arg quoting. (Also, if I add readline support etc, not65tube will add a dependency the upstream may not want to insist on for a basc tool like run6502, plus the code will start to get really big and kind of take over run6502.c. Even more so if I start adding optional "instant" keyboard reading and/or curses tewrminal emulation.

Despite the MIT/X11-ish claim in COPYING, the bit about "claim appear in supporting documentation" is pseudo advertising clausish and thus may render the licence GPL incompatible. To play it safe, it would therefore be better to use something like editline instead of readline.

If I do add editline/curses support, they should be conditionally compiled. I may never do it, but it would be nice to retain the option of compiling this up for eg RISC OS to compare it with the real 65Tube emulator
